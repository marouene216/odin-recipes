        <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>Here it is… the recipe many have been waiting for. It’s one of Tunisia’s most popular dishes – COUSCOUS!</p>
           <p>Couscous is small steamed balls of crushed durum wheat semolina that is traditionally served with a stew made with vegetables and a protein (either chicken, lamb, fish, octopus, or Gadid).
           Couscous is known to be a staple in the Arab Maghreb region. Each country has its own way of making it. This recipe is the Tunisian way. It is eaten frequently in Tunisian households – at least once or twice a week. 
           It symbolizes comfort, warmth, and tradition. </p>
           <p>The steps to making Tunisian Couscous are pretty much the same for all types of protein. There are minor changes in the spices. For example, cumin, coriander & caraway are used with fish and octopus but not for chicken and lamb. Garlic is used for chicken, fish, and octopus, but not for lamb.
            The dish seems elaborate and difficult, but trust me, it is not. Once you have the steps and make it a couple of times, you will be so comfortable cooking it. </p>
